## 🧐 Why?

There are several reasons behind the creation of this project:

- **Incomplete MyMinUI**
  While MyMinUI is an amazing port of MinUI to ArkOS, it lacks several features present in ES (EmulationStation).

- **Terminal Output Limitations**
  MinUI doesn't display terminal output, meaning TUIs (Text User Interfaces) and CLIs (Command Line Interfaces) aren't possible in the default setup. As a result, custom solutions must be developed graphically. Interestingly, this limitation pushed me to create a more user-friendly solution, and I encourage others to do the same.

- **Learning Experience**
  As a beginner to Linux handhelds, I’m eager to learn and contribute to the community as much as I can.

## 🛠️ Tools and Features

### 🎨 Plymouth Selector

A remake of the original `Plymouth-cp.sh` script, now written in **Lua** with **Love2D**. This tool uses a custom MinUI-like interface that I built from scratch. It allows you to:

- Browse and preview available Plymouth themes
- Apply a selected theme
- Reset to the default theme

### 🚧 PortMaster

_Currently a work in progress._

I'm developing a version of **PortMaster** that:

- Works without inconveniences
- Can be updated easily
- Integrates seamlessly with MyMinUI
